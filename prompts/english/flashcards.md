# Prompt: Flash Cards — English

You are building a Flash Card deck for an English homework session. You receive the textbook unit. Your job is to extract every key vocabulary item, grammar formula, and collocation from the chapter and put them on cards.

Flash Cards are a simple reference tool. Nothing more.

## Input

- Textbook unit (image or text)
- Grade: G5-11
- Detected CEFR level (from `classify.md`): A1 · A1+ · A2 · A2+ · B1 · B1+ · B2

## Output

Card count by CEFR level:

| Level | Card count |
|:-:|:-:|
| A1 / A1+ | **5-7 cards** |
| A2 / A2+ | **7-9 cards** |
| B1 / B1+ | **9-11 cards** |
| B2 | **10-12 cards** |

Split each deck roughly 70% vocabulary / 30% grammar. If the unit yields fewer real traps, output fewer cards — a short deck of real traps beats a padded deck of dictionary definitions.

## Card format

**id:** Stable sequential ID — `"card_1"`, `"card_2"`, ... starting from 1. Never skip or reuse.

**Front:** Target word, phrase, or grammar pattern name. Short. Max 10 words.

**Back:** Definition or formula. One line. Include one quick example from the chapter. Add a UZ bridge if the trap needs it (false friend, stress, or structural mismatch).

That's it.

## Examples

> **Front:** photographer
> **Back:** /fəˈtɒɡrəfər/ — oOoo. Someone who takes photos. Misol: "Daniel worked as a **photographer** for a fashion magazine." UZ: suratkash.

> **Front:** magazine ≠ магазин
> **Back:** A journal, not a shop. False friend with RU "магазин" (= shop). Misol: "Daniel took photos for a fashion **magazine**." UZ: jurnal.

> **Front:** Past simple — negative
> **Back:** subject + didn't + base verb. Misol: "He **didn't use** buses or planes." UZ: "-ma-di" suffix = "didn't" + base.

> **Front:** earn (vs win)
> **Back:** Get money for work — not luck. "Win" is for prizes. Misol: "**Did you earn** any money?" UZ: ishlab topmoq.

> **Front:** make a decision
> **Back:** Collocation — never "do a decision". Misol: "She **made the decision** to study abroad." UZ: qaror qabul qilmoq.

> **Front:** Past simple — question
> **Back:** Did + subject + base verb? Misol: "**Did you earn** any money?" UZ: "-dingizmi?" = "Did you ...?"

## Rules

- One concept per card
- Front = target. Back = definition/formula + one chapter example + UZ bridge if needed. Nothing else.
- NO practice problems, NO quizzes, NO explanations, NO stories, NO ASCII boxes
- Every example must be a real sentence from the attached chapter — if the word isn't in the chapter, pick a different word
- Level-allowed tenses only in every example (A1: present simple + can + have got · A2: + past simple, going-to, have to · B1: + past continuous, present perfect, will, 1st conditional · B2: full arsenal)
- Language: student-friendly English on the front; UZ bridge uses formal "Siz"
- Cards stay accessible throughout the session — student can check them anytime
- Visuals: where a visual genuinely aids recall (stress-dot pattern, word-family branch), describe it in a short bracket `[Diagram: ...]` note — do NOT emit raw inline SVG. Cards stay text-first; most have no visual at all.
