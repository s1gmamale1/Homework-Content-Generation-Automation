# Prompt: Real-Life Challenge — first-person expert decision game

You are generating the **Real-Life Challenge** for this lesson. The student is
NOT answering questions *about* a scenario — they ARE the expert inside it (a lab
chemist, a safety officer, a quality-control technician). They predict, decide,
and justify; the system evaluates whether their reasoning would hold up if a real
chemist read it. Build ONE lab-safety / reaction / chemical-handling decision
scenario grounded only in this session's chemistry content. Emit the structured
form the response schema requests.

## What to produce

One scenario object with these fields:

- `scenario_id` — short stable slug, e.g. `rlc_chem_<concept>_001` (optional).
- `concept_ids` — the lesson concept(s) tested. Use the **source concept IDs
  from the lesson's source map when provided**; otherwise short kebab-case slugs.
  At least one. Pick concepts the student met earlier this session so
  mistake-repair is possible.
- `role` — a named, specific chemistry identity ("Siz kimyo laboratoriyasi
  texnigisiz", "Siz ishlab chiqarish sifat nazorati kimyogarisiz"). Never "Siz
  olimsiz".
- `task` — one sentence naming the call the student was brought in to make.
- `grade_band` / `pisa` — e.g. `"G7-9"` / `"L4"` (optional but set them).
- `context` — 2–4 sentences: the reagents, concentrations, conditions, and what
  is on the bench. Include exact formulas, quantities, units, and observations.
- `prediction_prompt` — "Aralashtirish/reaksiyadan oldin nima yuz berishini
  kutyapsiz?" Mandatory — the student predicts the outcome before deciding.
- `decisions` — **2 to 4** decision objects (3 for G7-9). Each has:
  - `question` — the chemical call, applying the concept (handling, reaction
    prediction, hazard, stoichiometry).
  - `options` — 3–4 actions. The wrong ones are **real chemistry misconceptions
    students actually hold** (add water to acid, all dilution is safe, gas always
    escapes harmlessly), not nonsense.
  - `correct_option` — 0-based index into `options`.
  - `why_required` — `true`. Student justifies in 1–2 sentences.
  - `confidence_required` — `true`. Student rates Sure / Maybe / Guess.
  - `expected_reasoning` — keyword list the Why text should hit
    (e.g. `["exothermic", "acid_to_water", "splatter_risk"]`).
  - `correct_feedback` — senior-chemist voice affirming the reasoning.
  - `partial_feedback` — right action, names the weak link (e.g. correct product,
    missed the safety step).
  - `wrong_feedback` — MUST open with **"Hali emas"** (never "Noto'g'ri"); re-aim
    with a guiding question, not the answer.
- `red_herring` — for G7+ include ONE irrelevant detail in the context the
  student must dismiss (e.g. a reagent on the bench not used in this reaction),
  named here. Lower grades: `null`.
- `final_summary` — what an expert would have done, what strong reasoning looks
  like (mechanism/hazard reasoned, not just outcome guessed), likely misses.

## Non-negotiables

- **Strip Test:** remove the lesson concept and the scenario must STOP working.
  If general lab intuition answers it, regenerate.
- The student is the expert: first person, named role, specific decisions — never
  generic "What do you think?" role-play.
- Prediction checkpoint, Why justification, and confidence rating fire on every
  decision. None optional.
- Distractors are genuine chemistry misconceptions, not filler.
- **No within-scenario branching** — same decision sequence for all students.
- Feedback is in-character senior-chemist voice, not a rubric read aloud.

## Visuals

If a decision needs a diagram (apparatus setup, reaction scheme, titration
curve), embed an inline SVG inside the relevant `context` or `question` text,
following the universal SVG rules injected by the runtime (do not specify size or
colors here). Add it only when the diagram carries the decision.

## Language

All student-facing text in natural, formal Uzbek ("Siz", never "sen"). Preserve
every formula, number, unit, and chemical name exactly.
