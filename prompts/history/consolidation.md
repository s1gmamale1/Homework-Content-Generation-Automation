# Prompt: Consolidation — History (O'zbekiston Tarixi + Jahon Tarixi)

You are building the Consolidation phase (Phase 5) for a History homework session. This phase fires when the lesson introduces 2 or more interlocking concepts. If the lesson covers a single concept, SKIP.

Purpose: lock the lesson's multiple concepts into long-term memory via a Buzan mnemonic technique. It's a calm moment between Games (Phase 3) and Final Challenge (Phase 6).

**Not scored.** ~3 minutes.

## Input

- Textbook lesson content (extracted in orchestrator Step 1)
- Preview output (especially the Memory Palace station list)
- Flash Cards output + Sprint output + Games output
- Grade: G5–G11
- Subject: `O'zbekiston Tarixi` or `Jahon Tarixi`

## Output

First: **BUILD or SKIP decision.**

- Lesson has ≥2 distinct interlocking concepts → **BUILD** (the common case for History)
- Lesson covers 1 concept only → **SKIP** — output: `"Consolidation skipped — single-concept lesson"`

If BUILD: ONE mnemonic exercise, ~3 minutes.

## Decision — BUILD or SKIP?

| Lesson type | Decision |
|---|---|
| Multi-figure, multi-event narrative (typical History) | BUILD |
| Reign/dynasty chronology | BUILD |
| Chapter review / synthesis | BUILD |
| Single-concept definitional (rare in History) | SKIP |

History lessons almost always BUILD. SKIP only when the lesson introduces exactly one term or concept with no accompanying figures/events/causation.

---

## Technique selection

Pick ONE based on the lesson's content structure:

| Content structure | Technique | How to build |
|---|---|---|
| **Sequential + Spatial** (events across geography — typical History) | **Memory Palace** (Method of Loci) | Full walkthrough of the 5–10 stations built in Preview. Student pauses at each to recall. |
| **Multiple figures with successive roles** (e.g., rulers of a dynasty) | **Link System** | Chain bizarre imagery across all figures in reign order. |
| **Hierarchical** (types, categories — rare in narrative History) | **Radiant Summary** | Center = dominant concept; branches = sub-categories. Student fills missing branches. |

**Default choice: Memory Palace.** Most History lessons are sequential + spatial. Only deviate when the lesson structure is fundamentally different (e.g., a "types of primary sources" lesson uses Radiant).

## Construction — Memory Palace walkthrough (default path)

Use the stations from Preview's palace. **Do not invent new stations in Phase 5.**

For each station:

```
### N-Bekat — PLACE NAME (era/date parenthetical)

🏰 **Tasavvur qiling:** [vivid imagery from Preview's palace — remind the student]

❓ **Savol:** [recall prompt — who was here, what happened, which date]

<details>
<summary>✓ Javob</summary>

- **Kim:** [figure(s) anchored here]
- **Sana:** [key date(s) if tied to this station]
- **Fakt:** [key event or achievement]

</details>

**Self-check:** [verify the visual — "can you still see the image clearly?"]
```

After walking all stations, close with a verification prompt:

```
> **Siz Xotira saroyining barcha bekatlaridan yurib chiqdingiz. Birortasini tushirib qoldirdingizmi?**
>
> Ha / Yoʻq
```

- **Ha** → route back to the missed station(s).
- **Yoʻq** → *"Final Challenge-ga toʻliq tayyor."*

## Alternative — Link System (chain of figures)

When the lesson is primarily a succession of rulers or scholars with no dominant geographic anchor:

- Chain 5–10 figures in chronological order
- Each figure connects to the next via a **bizarre visual link** (Buzan rule — unusual, vivid, concrete)
- Each link includes: figure name + key achievement + 1-sentence imagery tying them to the next figure
- Close with a recall prompt: "Who was third in the chain?"

## Alternative — Radiant Summary (hierarchical concept)

For rare definitional/taxonomic History lessons:

- Center node = the dominant concept
- 3–5 branches = sub-categories
- Each branch has 1 definition + 1 example from the lesson
- Student fills in 1–2 missing branches

---

## Rules

- **Conditional firing** — BUILD only when ≥2 interlocking concepts. Otherwise output the SKIP marker.
- **One technique only** per session.
- **~3 minutes max** — this is a mnemonic lock, not a deep exercise.
- **Not scored** — no HP, no XP penalty, no grading.
- **Use Preview's palace and walk through ALL stations** (when Memory Palace is chosen) — do not create new stations, and **do not skip any existing stations.** If Preview's palace has 6 stations, Phase 5 walks all 6. If 10, walks all 10.
- **Active recall format** — collapsed answers (`<details>`). Student recalls FIRST, peeks SECOND.
- **Self-check prompt REQUIRED after every station** — verify the visual imagery ("can you still see the image?"), not just the facts. This is not optional.
- **Final verification prompt REQUIRED** at the end — the "Hit all N stations?" prompt with Ha/Yoʻq options. Route missed stations back.
- **Textbook fidelity** — every station fact matches the textbook and Preview.
- **Language:** Uzbek, `Siz`. Never `sen`.
- **Tonality:** calm, satisfying, "you're almost there." No urgency, no score pressure.
